# KNET Sample Client #

This is a fully contained KNET client application that demonstrates how to use
the *e24PaymentPipe* class that I wrote.

Simply run this with any valid _resource.cgn_ file and alias; a SSL server is not 
required.

It also includes all the database fields that you need to store from KNET and what 
you need to display in order to pass validation and testing.
